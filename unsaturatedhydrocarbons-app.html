  Common Alkene/Alkyne Applications</font>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Butadiene</li>
  <p>
    This organic molecule is commonly used in manufactoring different types of plastic and rubber. Specifically, it is used most commonly in the creation of PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride). The most common industry used structure of Butadiene is 1,3-Butadiene. Due to its gaseous state at room temperature, it has been found as a polutant in the air due to constant industry and motor emission.
  </p>
  <li>Ethylene</li>
  <p>
    Ethylene is an organic molecule used primarily as a plant hormone. It strengthens the ripening of fruit that comes off the flowers of the plant, aling with regulating the blooming of the flowers as well. Usually, plants are put in "ripening rooms", where ethanol liquid reacts to create ethylene gas that spreads throughout the room. This molecule also causes leaves on plants to fall off.
  </p>
  <li>Naphthalene</li>
  <p>
    This unsaturated organic molecule is commonly used as a fumigant. Fumigants are methods of pest control that kills or deters bugs by filling up the are with a certain type of gas. Naphthalene was used heavily in the past, especially in things like mothballs, to deter pests in attics, soil, and even museum storage. They have been mostly fazed out due to health problems it can cause such as damage to red blood cells in humans.
  </p>
  <li>Tetrachloroethylene</li>
  <p>
    This organic molecule is used primarily in dry cleaning, as well as being widely used for paint remover. This molecule is also stable, volatile, and nonflammable, which is why it is used for dry cleaning. The last thing that the molecule is used for is neutrino detectors, these are used to make argon from chlorine (the neutron in a chlorine atom is converted to a proton).  </p>
