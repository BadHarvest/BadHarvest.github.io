  Common Aldehyde/Ketone Applications</font>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formaldehyde</li>
  <p>
    Formaldehyde (the most simple form of an aldehyde) has a wide variety of uses in medical, industrial, and cosmetic fields (although has been phased out over time due to carcinogenic properties). One common use of formaldehyde is a precursor to make other complex materials and compounds. Formaldehyde is a good electrophile, meaning that it can participate in electrophilic aromatic substituion to produce hydroxymethtlated derivatives. Along with this, formaldehyde can be used as a preservative and as a disinfectant due to its ability to kill bacteria and fungi.
  </p>
  <li>Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate</li>
  <p>
    This long and complicated molecule is commonly used in the production of polyurethane. Polyurethane is often found in a foam format which provides good thermal insulation and is used in most freezers and refrigerators around the world. Along with this, it is also found to be a very high strength adhesive which is used in various high-strength glue products and formulas.
  </p>
  <li>Cinnamaldehyde</li>
  <p>
    This unique molecule is the primary component in cinnamon that gives it its unique and spicy flavor and odor. The compound is often found in liquid form which comes from the bark of cinnamon trees in a clear-yellow color. The extraction of this compound from the cinnamon trees is often used in essential oils for the cinnamon scent. Along with this, it used in other food products as a flavoring. For instance Cinnamaldehyde is found in ice cream, chewing gum, soda, and butterscotch. Cinnamon flavored candies can contain high concentrations of the aldehyde in order to match the scent and flavor of cinnamon.
  </p>
  <li>Vanillin</li>
  <p>
    Similar to Cinnamaldehyde, Vanillin is a compound that is the common componenet and extract of vanilla beans. The sweet and lavish smell along with the sweet taste is from this compound that is present in the vanilla beans. However, not many vanilla beans are extracted for their vanillin in modern times, as synthetic vanillan is often produced at much cheaper costs and more effeciently. The difference between the synthetic and extracted vanillin is the concentration, as synthetic vanillin is often used in higher concentrations than the vanillin that is extracted (due to the extracted vanillin having other compounds mixed in with it from the vanilla bean).
