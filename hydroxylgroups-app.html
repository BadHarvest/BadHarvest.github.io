  Common Alcohol/Phenol/Thiol Applications</font>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ethanol</li>
  <p>
    This molecule, while also used recreationally as a psychoactive drug, is also used as a common anti-septic used in wipes, hand sanitizer, and other common uses as a disinfectant. Ethanol works to kill bacteria and organisms by "denaturing" the proteins in thier body and dissolving their lipids. Of course, it is also used as a central nervous system depressant, as well as being a usual medical solvent for things such as pain medication.
  </p>
  <li>Phenol</li>
  <p>
    During the early ages when phenol was first being experimented with, it was used as a soap (carbolic soap). This was due to Joseph Lister discovering its antiseptic properties. Along with this, it is also used in a process called matrixectomy, which is the process of removing ingrown toe nails and finger nails using specific chemicals (as first discovered/discribed by Otto Boll). In modern times, it is used as an active ingredient in oral analgesics and is a preservative in some vaccines. Other than medical uses it is used in paint stribbers and in the aviation industry for epoxy removal.
  </p>
  <li>Methanethiol</li>
  <p>
    This thiol is used primarily in the production of methionine, which is a dietary factor and component in the creation and manufacturing of poultry and animal feed. It is used as a intermediate and a moderator for polymerizations, the precursor in the manufacturing process of pesticides, and as an odorant due to its compatibilty with methane. It has a very distinct smell of "rotten eggs", and is widely known as an indicator of a possible gas leak if it is smelled from within a home/structure.
    </p>
  <li>2-Octanol</li>
  <p>
    2-Octanol is used for a variety of purposes and factors. For one, it is used as a low-volatility solvent for resins, agrochemicals, and mineral extractions. It is used as a defoaming agent as well for oil, gas, pulp, and coal. Along with this, it is used primarily as a reaction intermediate for the creation of various other chemicals and molecules. These include: pesticides, lubricants, emollients, surfactants, perfumes, and disinfectant soaps. The molecule has also had research performed on it for its use in being a factor in controlling Essential Tremors and other neurological tremors.
