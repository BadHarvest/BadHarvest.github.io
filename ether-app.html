  Common Ether Applications</font>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dimethoxyethane</li>
  <p>
    This molecule is a colorless liquid that is used as a solvent in lithium batteries, one of the most common batteries in phones and other electronics. Specifically, this molecule is used as the solvent for the electrolytes in the lithium batteries. Other additional uses include being used in organometallic chemistry due to the formation of chelate complexes with cations and the fact that it acts as a bidentate ligand.
  </p>
  <li>Methoxymethane</li>
  <p>
    Methoxymethane is one of the primarily focused research items when studying subtitutions for propane in LPG (liquified petroleum gas) for use in industry and households. Along with this, it has shown promise in diesel enginees as fuel, as the high cetane number (indication of the combustion speed of the diesel fuel and the compression needed for ignition) of 55 makes it more advantageous when compared to petroleum's cetane number of 40-53. Sligh modifications are needed to make a diesel engine burn methoxymethane, making it very advantageous for a potential fuel source for these specific engines.
  </p>
  <li>Tetrahydrofuran (THF)</li>
  <p>
    This molecule is often used in the laboratory for a variety of purposes. For one, it is a popular solvent when the miscibility with water is not an issue. Along with this, it used commonly in hydroboration reactions in organometallic chemistry to produce organolithium and Grignard reagents. THF also plays a role in the hydroboration reactions that allows alcohols to be created with anti-markovnikov properties in terms of the location of the -OH and -H.
  </p>
  <li>Polyethylene glycol</li>
  <p>
    Polyethylene glycol is used in both the labratory and for medical uses. Medical wise, it is often used as the basis for many laxatives. Along with this, bowel irrigation with PEG can be added with electrolytes in order for bowel preparation before colonoscopy and other surgeries. Labratory-wise, it's hydrophilic nature is utilized in microscope slides for avoiding the sticking of proteins in fluorescence studies. However, the compound is also used for a variety of other things such as the preservation of objects that have been salvaged underwater. It replaces wood in drenched objects which helps the wood prevent warping and making it more structurally stable.
